Explorer One, this is Ground Control. Welcome to Ryugu, a near-Earth object and a potentially hazardous asteroid of the Apollo Group. The name 'Ryugu' is derived from a dragon’s palace in a classic Japanese fairy tale, symbolizing the journey of a fisherman who ventured to the bottom of the ocean and returned with a mysterious box. In a similar vein, Japan’s Hayabusa2 mission made its landmark voyage to Ryugu, landing on the asteroid in 2018. This mission was pivotal in studying Ryugu up close, and it succeeded in returning samples to Earth in December 2020, offering us invaluable insights. It is known to have a very rough surface, numerous boulders, and a relatively fast rotation, it has yet to be fully explored, watch yourself out there.

Explorer-One, welcome to Vesta, the second-largest asteroid in our Solar System, extensively mapped by NASA's Dawn Mission in 2011. It is home to the giant Rheasilvia mountain at the south pole, towering higher than Earth's Mount Everest. Vesta's landscape is a testament to the marvels of the cosmos. Proceed with awe and caution. Ground Control out.
