Welcome to our Asteroid Explorer Project!
To get started, follow these steps:

Unzip this file in your local machine
or clone our Github repo from: https://github.com/AdrianCCollier/asteroid-explorer.git

do:

cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install
npm run dev (this starts the backend localhost:3000 and frontend localhost:3001 together)

We accumulated quite a large amount of files and folders over the semester, here are our three main components:

/backend -> nodejs expressjs server with mongodb. The main logic is in /backend/server.js

/frontend/src -> Our React Application, this massive folder contains our solar system UI
/frontend/src/game -> Our Phaser game, the game exists and is mounted when a user clicks on an asteroid within React

Backend endpoints:
localhost:3000/api/asteroids
localhost:3000/api/custom-asteroids

Frontend endpoints:
localhost:3001/landing
localhost:3001/intro
localhost:3001/solarSystem
localhost:3001/level0
localhost:3001/level1
localhost:3001/level2
localhost:3001/level3

This game is fully deployed via AWS LightSail and can be played by visiting:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
